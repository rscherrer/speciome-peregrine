Instructions

Run the updateProfile script to add relevant modules to bash profile. Or, change that hidden file yourself. The script just adds a few lines to the profile.

Clone the speciome repo. Go in there and checkout another branch if you do not want to use the default branch.

Build the program using the available script. Or alternatively compile the executable yourself. With the script you can decide where to build the executable. Defaults to a folder inside the current wd. The script assumes it will find the speciome.pro file inside the speciome folder, accessible from the current wd. If you move speciome somewhere else, make sure you run this script from the parent directory to speciome.
